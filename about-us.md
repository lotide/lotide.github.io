### Ian Park | [GitHub](https://github.com/duckonomy)
Ian Park is an enthusiast of systems software and content-creation software. His passion is to provide content-creators with intuitive and modern software. He has experienced a lack of a standardized music production software on Linux. Thus, he has always been interested in indulging in the endeavor of researching and developing such software. Through this project, he hopes to bring a better standard for the cross-platform music production ecosystem.

Matthew Nykamp is a music hobbyist and game developer in his free time, and his experiences - a lack of an accessible, easy-to-use adaptive music creation tool - led to the genesis of this project. He hopes to create a tool that other creators like him can use.
